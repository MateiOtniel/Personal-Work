This is a repository where I have uploaded small projects in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

What I've learned during these mini-projects:

- what is an API
- what is and how to use fetch
- what does async, await
- what is a HTTP request
- how to use JavaScript to change different HTML and CSS proprieties
- how to use CSS for a better styling
- how to structure the HTML classes and IDs in a more logical way
